# Energy-Efficient Streetlight Control System

## Overview

This project aims to reduce electricity consumption, estimated to represent 19% of the world's total energy consumption. The system will attempt to activate the bulbs only when a person or a car passes, detecting motion and in low light conditions.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino
- C
- Python

## Hardware Description

### Software Description
This application was developed using the MIT App Inventor online editor for Android. It consists of five buttons that transmit the corresponding codes for the system's functionalities.

## Functionalities

The application offers the following functionalities:

- For value "0": Turn off the LED.
- For value "1": Turn on the LED.
- For value "2": Toggle based on motion sensor.
- For value "3": Toggle based on light sensor.
- For value "4": Toggle based on both sensors.

Through an Android application, we connect to the Bluetooth module. It transmits data to the Arduino board, which executes commands based on the values received through buttons. After creating the application, a .apk file is generated, which we install on the phone, or we scan the QR code using the MIT AI2 Companion app downloaded on the phone, and then install the application. The next step is pairing the phone with the Bluetooth module. Follow these steps:

1. Activate the Bluetooth function on the mobile phone.
2. Pair the two devices.
3. Start the application.
4. Connect the two devices.
